22nd August 2019 Meeting with Arjun


New automation should be done for Cloud and On-Prem both.

Testing end-to-end for whole product is not required.

80% of the product will be tested through API driven model.
20% of the product will be tested by integration, UI based test or end-to-end testing.

Divided use cases scenarios as components.

API test cases also can be run as component level.

Model for other test cases like Tez etc.

Currently:
Running test case in backend and update in JSON and validate it as part of application page.
LR daemon populates the elastic search in test cases.

We have to separate the UI and testing. Validate a core logic in the backend, no need to validate end-to-end UI.

Isolate the data for test cases., use synthetic data in test cases.

For long running test cases, maintain a different test suite.

Test case should be the same and data load/payload should decide the time required to run a test case, so long running test cases should be decided by its payload and test case should not be static.

Data driven test cases. Feed different data sets to the test cases.

Call the same API test and pass in negative test data and check the output in future.

Externalise the parameters to the test cases.
Include the expected output parameters to the test cases for the verification.
